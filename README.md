To run NetLogo files, open `.nlogo` file in current version of [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) and make sure the corresponding `.nls` file is in the same directory. 

Adjust any of the sliders or dropdown selectors in the `Interface` tab before hitting `setup` and then `go`. 

To rerun the same parameters with a different intialization, make sure to change the `seed-no` slider.
